# GUI_ImageProcessing
This is the Image Processing Code using Matlab with the GUI FIG

The purpose of this program is to modify images by implementing all
subjects of Image Processing and Understanding to learn how the process of
modifying Image using code.
The scope of this program is :
- Basic Operation
- Image Transformation
- Image Advancement

the firstly you need to do is Download and Install Matlab in your computer untill the display looks like this

Download the Code GUI_BS.m and GUI_BS.fig to use our template

after that click "guide" then click open existing file, find the directory path which contains GUI_BS.fig

our fig template will looks like this, but not only that to see if the fig is work properly or not, try to click the green triangle to run the program

the program that run the GUI_BS.fig is GUI_BS.m, all the code is already there, you can modify the code to suitable for your needs
if the program work properly you can try to import the image and then try to manipulate the image from all the function in button

for example I've already import the image and then want to manipulate the orginial image become Black & White Image

this is the list of Function Button We've made 
- Scaling
- Rotation
- Flip
- Distance measurement
- Black and white
- Complement of image (negative color)
- Create noise
- Noise reduction
- Greyscale
- Histogram
- Intensity light
- RGB
- Edge detection
- Image sharpening
- Image restoration
- Reset
- Exit
- Save

Thankyou see you in the next project ^ ^
